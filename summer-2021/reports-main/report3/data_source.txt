Uniform Crime Reporting (UCR) Program Data:

* Supplementary Homicide Reports (SHR) 

- For each homicide incident the database contains the age, gender, race, and ethnicity of each victim and offender.
- Also provides the agency involved, the month, and the year the crime happened.
- Generally less reliable than CDC Wonder database for homicide.
- Contains information about all involved offenders, sometimes suppressed even if there are multiple offenders. 
- In cases where there is no information about the offender, including how many offenders there is, the data simply says that there is a single offender. So the number of homicides with a single offender is an overcount while the number with more offenders is an undercount.
- The variable “situation” says what type of victim-offender number combination the incident is - e.g. “multiple victims/single offender,” “single victim/multiple offenders,” etc. - and does indicate if the number of offenders is unknown (though curiously there are over 4,000 instances where the number of offenders is unknown but they still say there are two offenders) so you can use this variable to determine if the police don’t know how many offenders there is.


* Offenses Known and Clearances by Arrest dataset (OKCA)

- Same issues of underreporting of the data.
- One of the ways this can be tackled is by working with state data where OKCA/SHR doesn't undercount compared to CDC
- violent index crimes - murder, rape, robbery, and aggravated assault - and property index crimes - burglary, theft, motor vehicle theft.


* Centers for Disease Control and Prevention 

- Most probably doesn't have county level data
- CDC WONDER data aggregates mortality data from state death certificates which reduces the issue of voluntary reporting

-- 


* National Incident-Based Reporting System (NIBRS)

- Major limitation: 8,500 police agencies reported NIBRS data in 2019. The ones who do report, are rural. So we are missing out on major police departments. 


* National Vital Statistics System 

- The NVSS mortality data are produced from standardized death certificates filed throughout the United States. The death
certificate data that the NVSS compiles include decedent age, race, ethnicity, marital status, resident status, educational attainment, residence, cause of death, and the nature of the injuries sustained. 

- Each year, a very small number of deaths remain without a manner of death or may be missing from the NVSS. It is believed that the NVSS covers 99% of the birth and death events in the United States.

- Data from the NVSS are typically reported according to the victim’s place of residence. Data on place of injury are available but not routinely reported in official statistics. 

- SHR data include intentional homicides known to law enforcement and exclude justifiable homicides and nonnegligent manslaughter. NVSS data include all homicides committed by civilians (regardless of intent) and exclude homicides
due to legal intervention. Both data sources exclude homicides resulting from operations of war and the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001. Rates are calculated as the number of homicides per 100,000 U.S. residents. SHR rates are
weighted to the annual number of homicide victims reported in the FBI’s Uniform Crime Reports.
